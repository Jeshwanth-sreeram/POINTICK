# POINTICK
This project implements a wireless glove-based mouse that allows users to control a computer cursor using hand gestures, flex sensors, and an IMU (accelerometer + gyroscope). The system consists of two Raspberry Pi Pico W devices on gloves and a third Pico W acting as a base station that transmits data to the computer via USB HID.
